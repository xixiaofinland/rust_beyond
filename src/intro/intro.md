# Introduction

Hi there, I'm [Xi Xiao](http://xixiao.info). This is a book to record my learnings
of [Rust-lang](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

This book exists from two reasons.

One, I want to learn how to communicate in writing. I'm really interested in how
great books, like [Flowers for Algernon][ffa], [The Phoenix Project][tpp], or
[Design Patterns][dp], convey information in a vivid yet simple manner. I think
this is a pretty huge ability! We're often taught, that there exist tradeoffs
when we make choices, and "powerful but complex" is a very common tradeoff. But
I see *powerful* and *simple* from these books, and I'd like to approach this
ability by practicing.

Two, I see a similar trait from Rust. High-level ergonomics like type inference,
concurrency without data races, and low-level control like memory allocation,
which seemingly conflicts, both appear in this language.

## How to read

The content of this book is split up into a few different sections. I attempt to
make sure that similar concepts are orgnized in the same section, and sections
are from simple to complex. But I'm not your dad, feel free to jump around and
cherry pick.

## Color theme

The book is built with [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook).

## Code samples


With that said, I hope you enjoy reading this book and get useful content
out of it!
