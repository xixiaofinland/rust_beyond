# Introduction

Hi there, I'm [Xi Xiao](http://xixiao.info). This is a book to record learnings
of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

This book exists from two reasons of mine.

One, I want to learn how to communicate in writing. I'm really interested in how
great books, like [Flowers for
Algernon](https://www.amazon.com/Flowers-Algernon-Daniel-Keyes/dp/015603008X),
[The Phoenix
Project](https://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business/dp/0988262592),
or [Design
Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612?s=books&sr=1-1)
convey information in a vivid yet simple manner. I think this is a pretty huge
ability! We're often taought, that there exist tradeoffs when we make choices,
and "powerful but complex" is a very common tradeoff. But I see *powerful* and
*simple* (at least seemingly simple) from these books, and I'd like to
deliberately approach this ability by practicing.

Two, I enjoy using Rust due to the same kind of trait I see from this language.
High-level ergonomics like type inference, concurrency without
data races, and low-level control like memory allocation, which seemingly
conflicts, both appear in this language.

With my reasons said, I hope you enjoy reading this book and get useful content
out of it!
