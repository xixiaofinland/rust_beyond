# How to read this book

## Content

The content of this book is split up into a few different sections. I attempt to
make sure that similar concepts are orgnized in the same section, and sections
are from simple to complex. But I'm not your dad, feel free to jump around and
cherry pick.

## Theme
The book is built with [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook).
