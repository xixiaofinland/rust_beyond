## Traits

Types in Rust are powerful and versatile. Traits define shared behavior that
multiple types can implement.

### Default implementations

Traits in Rust are similar to interfaces in other languages but can also provide
default implementations for methods.

Typically, an interface defines method signatures without any implementation. In
Rust, however, you can supply default method implementations directly within a
trait.

and see the result.

```rust
trait Greet {
    fn greet(&self) { // Default implementation
        println!("Hello from the default greeting!");
    }
}

struct Person;

impl Greet for Person {} // Uses the default implementation

fn main() {
    let person = Person;
    person.greet(); // Outputs: Hello from the default greeting!
}
```
We can, of course, override this default behavior like so:

```rust
# trait Greet {
#     fn greet(&self) {
#         println!("Hello from the default greeting!");
#     }
# }
#
# struct Person;
// --snip--

impl Greet for Person {
    fn greet(&self) { // Overwrite the default implementation
        println!("Hello from Person greeting!");
    }
}

fn main() {
    let person = Person;
    person.greet();  // Outputs: Hello from Person greeting!
}
```

### Traits as Function Parameters and Return Types

Once the Greet trait is defined, it can be used as a type for function
parameters and return values:

```rust
fn main() {
    let person = Person;
    do_greet(person);

    let returned = return_greet();
    returned.greet();
}

fn do_greet(greetable: impl Greet) { // Accepts any type implementing Greet
    greetable.greet();
}

fn return_greet() -> impl Greet { // Returns some type implementing Greet
    Person
}

// --snip--
# struct Person;
#
# impl Greet for Person {}
#
# trait Greet {
#     fn greet(&self) {
#         println!("Hello, greeting!");
#     }
# }

```

### For Common Functionality

When reading more and more Rust code, we see that experienced Rust developers
frequently use standard library traits. Rust provides common traits as both
guidelines and best practices. This not only helps us learn Rust but also
provide great references when programming in other languages.

Let's briefly explore some standard library traits to understand their practical
use.

- Clone
- Copy
- Display
- Debug
- Default
- Eq and PartialEq
- Ord and PartialOrd
- Iterator
- IntoIterator
- From/Into

These traits enable a rich set of tools that work seamlessly across many types.
Letâ€™s look at a few examples to illustrate their usefulness.

#### Debug

Sometimes, especially when troubleshooting, we want to quickly inspect the
contents of a variable, such as the `origin` instance of `Point` below.

```rust,does_not_compile
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let origin = Point { x: 0, y: 0 };
    println!("{:?}", origin); // not work
}
```

The `Debug` trait enables this by allowing types to be
printed using the `{:?}` formatter in macros like `println!`.
